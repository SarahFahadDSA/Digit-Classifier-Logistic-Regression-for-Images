# Digit-Classifier-Logistic-Regression-for-Images
This project, from the Simplilearn Introduction to Data Science course, builds a Logistic Regression model to recognize handwritten digits from blurred 8x8 grayscale images. The model is trained and tested for accuracy, and a confusion matrix is used to analyze correct predictions and misclassifications.
